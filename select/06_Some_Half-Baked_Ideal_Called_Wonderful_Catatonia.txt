La la la la la la la la
Mickey wishes he was dead, draws the sheet across his head
Never felt so alive
Moved him in to share the bed, turns out he's sharing her instead
Was it all worthwhile?
Must have been funny, must have been dim - cut it up and let it all in
Must have been funny, must have been dim - cut it up and let it all in

Don't want you to go, just need you to know
Can't leave the house: he wouldn't dare, hang this guilty frame with stares
Naked in a fray
I'll be the shortest person there, oh God I'm losing all my hair
It won't suit my style
Must have been funny, must have been dim - cut it up and let it all in

I don't want you to go, I just need you to know
I don't want you to go, I just need you to know
Do do do aa-aa-aa-aa-aah
She gave me nothing that I could bear to lose aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-ah
And if he reaches for the door, be sure he'll touch the wood and pause
Ask me back for more
We'll still shove us down the stairs, still get in each other's hair
If there's any left then
Must have been funny, must have been dim - cut it up and let it all in
I don't want you to go, I just need you to know
I don't want you to go, I just need you to know
Did you want him to go? did you push him to go where the ~~ girl lies
Where does the ~~ girl lie? why does she hide? why does she hide . .? (ad
Lib to fade)
